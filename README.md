## ResMem Analysis

This repository holds all of the code necessary for creating the feature visualizations in [_Embracing New Techniques in Deep Learning for Estimating Image Memorability_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.10598).

This repository is provided for informational purposes and is not considered distribution-ready. A large number of visualizations are provided in the resnet folder, and are also stored on [OSF](https://osf.io/qf5ry/). These are provided as a starting point if any future researchers would like to investigate the features used by ResMem to estimate image memorability.
